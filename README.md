# Illegal Logging Risk Modeling using GEE and MaxEnt

## Overview

This project analyzes spatial risk of illegal logging using environmental variables derived from remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling.
The workflow integrates **Google Earth Engine**, **MaxEnt modeling**, and **QGIS spatial interpretation** to identify environmental characteristics associated with illegal logging locations.

---

## Research Objective

To model and analyze spatial risk patterns of illegal logging based on environmental predictors such as:

- Elevation
- Slope
- Distance to rivers
- Distance to road
- Land cover characteristics
- Environmental suitability

The study aims to understand environmental conditions that potentially influence illegal logging activities.

## Google Earth Engine Stage

Environmental variables were prepared using Google Earth Engine.

Main steps:

- Satellite data collection
- Raster preprocessing
- Environmental feature extraction
- Export raster layers for modeling

The script can be found in: gee_script/
---

## MaxEnt Modeling

MaxEnt was used to model spatial suitability based on presence data.

### Inputs
- Illegal logging occurrence points
- Environmental raster variables

### Outputs
- Habitat suitability map
- Response curves
- Variable contribution analysis

Model outputs are stored in: results/

---

## QGIS Spatial Interpretation

QGIS was used to interpret spatial patterns.

Analysis performed:

- Overlay suitability map with environmental layers
- Interactive point inspection
- Extraction of environmental attributes at logging locations

Users can open the full project using: qgis_analysis/


---

## Key Output

The resulting suitability map highlights areas with higher potential risk of illegal logging activities based on environmental characteristics.
